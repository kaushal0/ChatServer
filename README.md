# ChatServer
Implementing a Chat Server using Python

A chat system with a multiple client scenario has been implemented here.
Server works on a multi threaded system. A thread is assigned to each client which process all the messages individually. The client works on the same model as well.

The Server consists of two groups which can handle multiple clients.

To run the server and client codes write 'python ServerCode.py' and 'python ClientCode.py' respectively on local machine.
The Server Starts on the port 40000 which has been hardcoded.
